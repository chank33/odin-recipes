# odin-recipes
first project

The first project of The Odin Project

"It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished but it’s important to keep in mind that the purpose of this project is to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS."

I will try and commit often, and meaningfully... in a uniform manner.
